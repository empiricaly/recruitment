# Empirica Recruitment - BETA

Empirica Recruitment is an application meant to simplify the operations needed
to recruit experiment participants using online participant platforms (only 
AWS MTurk supported at the moment).

**Empirica Recruitment is currently in early beta and will require some effort
from the user to setup and use.** It has been tested on limited experiments
with up to 100 participants and multiple steps.

# Quick Usage

Download the latest pre-built binary release from the
[releases page](https://github.com/empiricaly/recruitment/releases)
(currently only macos supported, adding other platforms soon).

Then copy the config file `recruitment.example.yaml` to `recruitment.yaml` in
the folder where you will be running recruitment from. Modify the configuration
as needed.

Make the binary you downloaded executable with:

```sh
chmod u+x ./recruitment
```

Finally run with:

```sh
./recruitment
```

It will create the SQLLite database in the same folder (`recruiment.db`) and
start the HTTP server on port 8880. Head over to http://localhost:8880.
